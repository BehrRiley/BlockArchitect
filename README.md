Block Architect
---------------

Block Architect allows to create custom blocks with custom or vanilla behavior. It does not spawn them into your world. 

This script is work in progress, breaking changes might happen, but should work as is.

Please report any issue you've come up with.

### Installation

1. Install the dependencies listed below.
2. Download Block Architect and drop the external folder into your `/plugins/Denizen/scripts` folder.
3. Configure your Ressource pack and your custom blocks. A sample file is in `/external/BlockArchitect/custom_blocks/iron.dsc`.
4. Join your Minecraft Server and type `/ex reload` to reload your scripts.

### Dependencies

Denizen: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/denizen.21039/

## Good to have

Please take some time to read [this](https://forum.denizenscript.com/threads/tiny-sample-scripts-to-start-with.354/) forum thread. It comes up with tiny useful scripts you can start with, but also contains an Auto-saver script that saves denizen files, which also BlockArchitect benefits from.
